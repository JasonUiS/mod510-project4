    "### How did we work?\n",
    "Basically, we worked on project in the group room, alongside with the lab classes which helped us a lot to discuss about the problems as well as finding the solution. We worked together even if any of us find any solution then we discussed about this and then came to a proper solution which looked like a good way of learning for us. Before finalizing any problem's solution, we together ended up with a good solution and agreed upon that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jason created some initial coding and worked on finding the solutions to the problem in theoretical matter. Taz and Tapas worked also on the theorectical matter proofs final Python code. Mussa wrote large sections of Python code and acted as Project Manager by compiling the individual contributions into a final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we did in the project?\n",
    "We evaluated the analtical, numerical and line-source solution with two different boundary conditions and also found out the error between them by visuallizing the graphs. Then we matched our well test data from the provided file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Learnings?\n",
    "We learnt the implementation of different numerical solvers for the radial deffusivity equation. We also learnt about PressureSolver Class. Besides, we also came across the learning of using two different boundary conditions. Although we did struggle in some stages but this project will help us in near future.future."
